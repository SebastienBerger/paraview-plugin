The Glyph filter generates a glyph (i.e., an arrow, cone, cube, cylinder, line, sphere, or 2D glyph) at each point in the input dataset. The glyphs can be oriented and scaled by the input point-centered scalars and vectors. The Glyph filter operates on any type of data set. Its output is polygonal. This filter is available on the Toolbar.
